/**
 * Programs demonstrating gof design patterns
 * OO principles:
 * 	1) Encapsulate what varies
 * 	2) Favor composition over inheritance
 * 	3) Program to interfaces not implementations
 * 	4) Strive for loosely coupled designs betn objects that interact
 * 	5) Classes should be open for extension but closed to modification
 * 	6) Depend on abstraction not concrete classes
 * 	7) Talk only to your friend/neighbor
 * 	8) Dont call us, we will call you
 * 	9) A class should have only one reason to change
 *
 * 	Pattern classification:
 * 	5 Creational patterns: Abstract Factory, Factory, Builder, Prototype, Singleton
 * 	7 Structural patterns: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy
 * 11 Behavioral patterns: Command, Chain of responsibility, Iterator, Interpreter,
 * 						   Memento, Mediator, Observer,
 * 						   State, Strategy, Template, Visitor
 *
 * 	Class Patterns: relationships defined by inheritance, established compile time
 * 	e.g. : Template, Factory, Adapter, Interpreter
 *
 * 	Object patterns: relationships between objects, primarily by composition, typically
 * 	                 created runtime and more dynamic and flexible
 * 	e.g. Abstract Factory, Builder, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Command ...
